  <h1>Laptop Price Prediction</h1>

  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>This project predicts the price of laptops based on their specifications, such as RAM, memory size, processor, etc.</p>

  <h2>Project Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1: Data Collection</li>
    <p>In this step, we collect all the data required to build the machine learning model.</p>

    Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation
    We clean and transform the collected data to make it suitable for building the machine learning model.

    Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
   In this step, we perform EDA and feature engineering to gain insights from the data and create relevant features.

    Step 4: Building the Machine Learning Model
    We build the machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm, which provides good R2 score and accuracy for price prediction.

    Step 5: Building the App using Streamlit
    We build an interactive app using Streamlit, where users can select variables (such as RAM, memory size, processor, etc.) and predict the price of the laptop.
