<h5>The Project was completed in the 5 steps</h5>
<li> step 1 Collect all the data</li>
<li> step 2 Clean and transform the data so we can use this data to build machine learning model</li>
<li> step 3 Perform Eda and feature engineering</li>
<li> step 4 Build the machine learning model random forest give us good R2 score and acccuracy</li>
<li> step 5 Build the app using streamlit in which we select the variable and they predict the price of the laptop</li>
